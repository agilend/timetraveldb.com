  <p>Imagine that time travel is invented in 2458 by a scientist called “Billy T. F.” that works for NASA.
<br><br>
He shares his research and his result on Time and he become “man of the year”.
<br><br>
He travelst to 1941, lets a man do a photo to him in modern clothes and just returns back to 2458 and after searching in an old newspaper he proved himself right.
<br><br>

But then some governments contact him. They want that time machine.
<br><br>
1)France wants to not go to Russia in 1811.
<br><br>
2)Germany wants to kill baby Hitler.
<br><br>
3)Italy wants to betray the Axis in WW2.
<br><br>
4)Russia wants to declare war on the rebellious 13 colonies in 1776 and not sell Alaska.
<br><br>
5)England wants to lower taxes in the 13 colonies.
<br><br>
He decides to freely publish the blueprint of his invention so that anyone can do what we wants
<br><br>
Suddendly his newspaper photo is modified. Seems like he is fading.
<br><br>
He starts to regret what he has done, and checks the newspaper another time: “50 times winner of the lottery shoots strange looking guy”.
<br><br>
So he has an idea: he contacts ONU and asks for a capable team that can stop rogue time travelers. Then suddenly disappears.
<br><br>
ONU sends a team searching for him and finds the newspaper photo without him.
<br><br>
They make A.T.T.T. (Anti Time Traveling Team) that is made up of 1 member from each of the ONU nations and 5 members from each of the permanent council.
<br><br>
They made littler groups that work in the shadows to stop people from time traveling.
<br><br>
They return to 1940, pass 1 year searching for Billy T. F. and find him just 1 day before his photo. Then they start to follow him and see what happens. After a few hours, a guy appears out of nowhere and shoots Billy T. F.
<br><br>
The A.T.T.T. goes back in time again and take hold of the strange guy and asks who he is.
<br><br>
He says that he is Billy T.F. and that he wants to stop the madness. So A.T.T.T. explains the situation and ask from when this Billy T.F. is. He says 2459.
<br><br>
A.T.T.T. understands all then and returns to the moments when this guy is about to kill Billy T.F. “You are being arrested by the Anti Time Traveling Team for rogue time traveling ”.
<br><br>
He answers, “There has been a mistake. I invented time traveling”.
<br><br>
But the leader of A.T.T.T., inflexible, answers, ”you’re a fake. We are here to save Billy T. F.”
<br><br>
They take him back to 2458 abd he is proven guilty and executed, but Billy T. F. is still missing.
<br><br>
ONU wants answers and A.T.T.T. is more confused than ever...
<br><br>
So A.T.T.T. turns back in 1941 and arrives just after A.T.T.T. arrests the guy. They tell them to wait, and then they wait 10 minutes for another guy that seems rich and they do the normal procedure for him.
<br><br>
Now there are 2 A.T.T.T., 2 Billy T.F., 1 murder and a lot of confusion, so the real Billy T.F., returns to 2458, and after one year of headache, decides to act in 2459 and returns back in 1941 to kill himself. Finding that he is actually the second Billy T.F., things happen as they should:
<br><br>
He arrives and shoots the first Billy T.F., the first A.T.T.T. arrives and arrest him and the second arrests the rich guy. Then in 2459 Billy T.F. disappear because he killed himself.
<br><br>
The rich guy turns out to be a Russian who used the blueprint to enrich himself and win 50 times at the lottery. He wanted to kill Billy T.F. so that no one could discover him, and found Billy T.F to be already dead. So A.T.T.T. just arrests him,
<br><br>
This is just the end of the first many A.T.T.T missions.
<br><br>
The team can finally rest.
<br><br>
Then a call arrives: ”A strange thing that looks like a pile is discovered in Baghdad”
<br><br>
-This is why we don’t have info of anyone who time travelled, because they all have been stopped.
