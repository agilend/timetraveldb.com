        <h1>Welcome to the Meta Quest of Mark Zuckerberg!</h1>
        <p>Did you know Facebook started in a <span class="pun">Harvard dorm room</span>? Who would have thought a place meant for studying could lead to <span class="pun">scrolling</span>?</p>
        
        <p>Mark Zuckerberg: the only guy who could make you <span class="pun">"poke"</span> your friends from a distance and still keep it social!</p>
        
        <p>From <span class="pun">dorm room</span> to <span class="pun">data room</span>: the real <span class="pun">Meta</span> transformation! Who knew playing <span class="pun">"Farmville"</span> could lead to a billion-dollar empire?</p>
        
        <p>With the Meta Quest, Zuck is just trying to take us back to the days of <span class="pun">"socializing"</span>... but in virtual reality! It's like Facebook, but without the annoying ads... oh wait, never mind!</p>
        
        <p>So hereâ€™s to Mark: the only CEO whoâ€™s also a <span class="pun">"dormitory dreamer"</span> turned <span class="pun">"virtual reality wizard"</span>. May your <span class="pun">algorithms</span> always be friendly!</p>
        
        <p>Remember, whether youâ€™re <span class="pun">"liking"</span> or <span class="pun">"sharing"</span>, always do it with a smileâ€¦ just like Zuck would (even if it's a little creepy)! ðŸ˜„</p>
